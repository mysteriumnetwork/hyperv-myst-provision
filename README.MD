Purpose of dual-mode:

## Installation

* Select item 1 or 2 to enable Mysterium Node.
   Note that Wifi support is experimental.
* Wait for the UI page to open in a browser.

## Known problems & solutions
**Network connection (Wifi) becomes slow after enabling the Node.**
* Disable packets coalescing on Wifi adapter. Go to Device Manager -> Network adapters -> right-click on Wifi adapter and select 'Properties'
Select 'advanced' tab, disable packets coalescing.
* Use a hardware Wifi bridge, a wired connection or a separate Wifi adapter (turn to support for futher instructions).
